## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Account System
```javascript
// Hybrid implementation with MetaMask Delegation Toolkit
const smartAccount = await toMetaMaskSmartAccount({
    implementation: Implementation.Hybrid,
    deployParams: [ownerAddress, [], [], []],
    deploySalt: salt,
    signer: { walletClient }
});
```

### Delegation Framework
Utilizes `@metamask/delegation-toolkit` to create limited permissions:
- **Restricted Scope**: Only the MONORAIL_AGREGATE function is allowed
- **Smart Caveats**: Time, amount, and balance change restrictions
- **Multi-layer Security**: Signature verification for each delegation
- **Subscription Support**: Recurring execution permissions with frequency limits

### Batch Operations Engine
- **Multi-call Aggregation**: Combine multiple token approvals and swaps into single transactions
- **Gas Optimization**: Reduced gas costs through batch processing
- **Quote Validation**: Pre-execution quote verification and fallback handling
- **Token Whitelisting**: Verified token prioritization for enhanced security

### Gas Optimization
- Integration with Pimlico for gas sponsorship
- Bundler client for user operation handling
- Paymaster integration for gasless transactions
- Batch gas savings for multiple operations

## üîí Security Analysis

### Security Features
**Delegation Caveats:**
- `limitedCalls`: Limits the number of executions (crucial for subscriptions)
- `allowedTargets`: Only the Monorail contract is allowed
- `timestamp`: Time-based execution restrictions
- `balanceChange`: Verification of balance changes

**Smart Account Protection:**
- Fund isolation through separate smart accounts
- Salt-based account generation
- Deployment verification
- Subscription limit enforcement (max 5 per account)

**Batch Convert Security:**
- Token verification and whitelisting
- Maximum value limits per batch
- Quote validation before execution
- Automatic failed token deselection

**Transaction Safety:**
- Slippage protection
- Minimum output guarantee
- Deadline enforcement
- Duplicate subscription prevention

### Risk Mitigation
```javascript
// Enhanced caveats for subscription security
const caveats = [
    {
        type: "erc20BalanceChange",
        tokenAddress: toToken.address,
        recipient: smartAccount.address,
        balance: BigInt(quote.min_output),
        changeType: BalanceChangeType.Increase,
    },
    {
        type: "limitedCalls",
        limit: subscriptionData.totalExecutions, // Fixed execution count
    }
];
```
