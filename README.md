#  Swifter - Advanced Swap Aggregator for MetaMask Smart Accounts

## üìã Executive Summary

**Swifter** is a revolutionary swap aggregator platform that leverages MetaMask smart accounts with advanced delegation technology, built on the **Monad** network. The platform delivers a secure, gas-efficient, and flexible automated trading experience with three main swap modes: direct, scheduled, and price-targeted.

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. **Direct Swap**
- Real-time swap execution at current market prices
- Direct integration with Monorail Swap Aggregator
- Customizable slippage tolerance
- Accurate gas fee estimates

### 2. **Scheduled Swap**
- Schedule swaps for specific future times
- Intuitive date and time picker interface
- Countdown timer for upcoming swaps
- Automated execution without user intervention

### 3. **Price Target Swap**
- Automated limit orders with specific price targets
- Flexible expiration periods (1 day to 1 year)
- Automatic calculation of minimum received amount
- Automated execution without user intervention

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Smart Account System**
```javascript
// Hybrid implementation with MetaMask Delegation Toolkit
const smartAccount = await toMetaMaskSmartAccount({
    implementation: Implementation.Hybrid,
    deployParams: [ownerAddress, [], [], []],
    deploySalt: salt,
    signer: { walletClient }
});
```

### **Delegation Framework**
Utilizes `@metamask/delegation-toolkit` to create limited permissions:
- **Restricted Scope**: Only the `MONORAIL_AGREGATE` function is allowed
- **Smart Caveats**: Time, amount, and balance change restrictions
- **Multi-layer Security**: Signature verification for each delegation

### **Gas Optimization**
- Integration with **Pimlico** for gas sponsorship
- Bundler client for user operation handling
- Paymaster integration for gasless transactions

## üîí Security Analysis

### **Security Features**
1. **Delegation Caveats**:
   - `limitedCalls`: Limits the number of executions
   - `allowedTargets`: Only the Monorail contract is allowed
   - `timestamp`: Time-based execution restrictions
   - `balanceChange`: Verification of balance changes

2. **Smart Account Protection**:
   - Fund isolation through separate smart accounts
   - Salt-based account generation
   - Deployment verification

3. **Transaction Safety**:
   - Slippage protection
   - Minimum output guarantee
   - Deadline enforcement

### **Risk Mitigation**
```javascript
// Example caveat for security
const caveats = [
    {
        type: "erc20BalanceChange",
        tokenAddress: toToken.address,
        recipient: smartAccount.address,
        balance: BigInt(quote.min_output),
        changeType: BalanceChangeType.Increase, // Only allow if balance increases
    }
];
```

## ‚ö° Core Workflows

### **Delegation Creation Flow**
1. **Initialization**: Set up smart account and swap parameters
2. **Quote Fetching**: Get the best price from Monorail
3. **Delegation Creation**: Create signed delegation with caveats
4. **Approval Handling**: ERC20 approval delegation for non-native tokens
5. **Submission**: Send delegation to backend API

### **Execution Flow**
1. **Validation**: Server validates delegation signature
2. **Monitoring**: System monitors market conditions/time
3. **Execution**: Automatic execution when conditions are met
4. **Confirmation**: Status update and user notification

## üé® User Experience & Interface

### **Interface Components**
- **SwapBox**: Main swap interface with intuitive token selection

- **Price Automation**: More flexible limit orders
- **Smart Account Management**: Multiple wallet support with guaranteed security

## üìä Performance Optimization

### **Efficiency Features**
- **Quote Caching**: Reduces unnecessary API calls
- **Batch Operations**: Multi-account management
- **Gas Price Optimization**: Dynamic gas pricing via Pimlico
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

### **Monitoring & Analytics**
- Real-time task tracking
- Transaction history with explorer links
- Comprehensive status updates
- Error reporting and resolution guidance

## üîÑ Integration Ecosystem

### **Third-party Integrations**
- **Monorail**: Swap aggregation engine
- **Pimlico**: Account abstraction services
- **Monad Testnet**: Blockchain infrastructure
- **MetaMask**: Wallet provider and delegation framework

### **Contract Architecture**
```javascript
// Core contract addresses
MONORAIL_CONTRACT = "0x525b929fcd6a64aff834f4eecc6e860486ced700";      // Swap aggregation
DELEGATOR_ADDRESS = "0x22f4b7Bca137cF91AE3d08B393167FADdA220eee";      // Scheduled swap Executor
DELEGATOR_ADDRESS_PRICE = "0x82eC492530cAef73fec8512054b070a0a35E0000"; // Price-based swap Execitor
```

## üöÄ Roadmap & Scalability
